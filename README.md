# env_weather
func_fog works by changing the fog levels for whoever enters the volume. You'll need to place a single env_weather to set up the "default" fog.

I think the weather type and density is hard-coded to always be high-density snow, so you need to edit the script to change that. Some other options in the FGD aren't implemented either.
